    One common flaw we've seen in many frameworks is a lack of support for truly responsive text. While elements on the page resize fluidly, text still resizes on a fixed basis. To ameliorate this problem, for text heavy pages, we've created a class that fluidly scales text size and line-height to optimize readability for the user. Line length stays between 45-80 characters and line height scales to be larger on smaller screens.</p>

  <p>To see Flow Text in action, slowly resize your browser and watch the size of this text body change!</p>
  
  <p>To alter flow-text break points, simply adjust the $interval amount and/or any of the numbers on line 19: <pre>font-size: 14px * (1 + (.2 * $i));</pre></p>
